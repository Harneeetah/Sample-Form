       <p> Hi,my name is Anita Okologo with Altschool id: ALT/SOE/024/1150. As an Altschool Africa student currently studying backend engineering, its been an interesting experience so far. By Altschool Africa standards, despite applying to study backend engineering, I am required to have a sound understanding and application of the frontend technologies such as Html,Css and Javascript.
       </p>
        <p> I am always interested and excited about technology and the way things work. Being a backend engineer would enable me build structures that add to the functionality of applications. I love to create things and this would be a perfect learning curve for me to practice, hone my skills and eventually become the worldclass engineer that i so desire.</p>
    <p> As one who loves knowledge, and would one day love to give back to the society, Altschool's detailed curriculum is preparing me for the mountain top of life, and would one love to partner with Altschool by granting scholarships to help other young African talents</p>
